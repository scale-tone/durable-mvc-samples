# durable-mvc-samples

A set of code samples for [durable-mvc-starter](https://github.com/scale-tone/durable-mvc-starter).

* [appointments-sample](https://github.com/scale-tone/durable-mvc-samples/tree/main/appointments-sample) - sample app for arranging appointments. User needs to login, then the app will display a list of existing appointments and allow to create new ones, by specifying the set of people invited. Appointments change their state based on responses received from participants.
* [universal-tracker](https://github.com/scale-tone/durable-mvc-samples/tree/main/universal-tracker) - sample app, that can track virtually any value reachable via HTTP GET and visualize it as a timeline graph or as a route map.
